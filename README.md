# SuperCollider-Software

A software collection to organize the musical sound

Made with SuperCollider 3.12 (For Mac OS X 10.13 to ...)

Very Quick Start:

Unzip the archive and run the program.
A window opens with a series of settings.
For the first time click only on the  « working folder » button.
A new window appears and select cancel.
A folder named « name of the software »  will be created in your "/Users/your home/Documents/name of the software/".
This is the default location folder where the presets and data will be saved.

For the rest, please explore and have fun.
