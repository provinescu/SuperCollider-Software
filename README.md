# SuperCollider-Software

A software standalone collection to organize the musical sound

Made with SuperCollider 3.12 (For Mac OS X 10.13 to ...)

Very Quick Start:

Unzip the archive and run the program
A window will open with a series of settings.
For the first use click only on the folder button and select cancel.
A folder named with the name of the program will be created in your "home/document/" directory.
This is where the presets and data will be saved.
You can of course later create other working folders.
For use with your sounds, edit the file named sound or list sound in the working directory, respecting the syntax.

For the rest, explore and have fun.
